These scripts will help running TapDance in production environments.
(Probably complicates logging too much in dev environments to warrant using it,
but I include a dev example (curveball) anyway).


To install, simply run `./install.sh` as root. This will install three sysvinit
files:
    -zbalance
    -tapdance
    -gobbler

and will copy a $(hostname)-specific config into (newly created) /etc/tapdance/


To run, simply:

    `sudo service zbalance start`
    `sudo service tapdance start`
    `sudo service gobbler start`

These will log to
    /var/log/tapdance/zbalance/
    /var/log/tapdance/
    /var/log/tapdance/gobbler/

respectively. You can see output with
    `tail -F /var/log/tapdance/current`
